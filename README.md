# My first coding project!

My English teacher asked me what I do as a hobby. I told her I'm learning to code, and I do programming in my free time. I love it. She then asked me to make a website for her so she can send it to people for introducting herself with links to her social media. 

This is how I got my first project without even asking for! It's so exciting for me. 

## My stack

- Next.js
- React
- React Native Web 

And I deploy to Vercel for hosting.
